# ar-image-capture
This is an augmented reality coloring application built in Unity engine and coded with Vuforia and OpenCV plugins.  
  
This project is intended to enable coloring pages to function as image targets for recognition and extract the painting to be applied to extended reality content, such as an animated 3D model.  
  
The algorithm can capture image targets from any angle with the device camera and extract their content to project them into a square image, so it can be used as a UV map to texture any model.  
  
To use AR Image Capture, you must first import the latest versions of both the OpenCV for Unity plugin and the Vuforia Engine SDK.
